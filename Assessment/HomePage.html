                        Washing: <br>
                        My hair routine is now very simplistic. Once a week I do a scalp treatment and nutrition mask overnight. 
                        I then wash these out the next day with a natural shampoo and conditioner. 
                        I always use cool water when washing my hair to prevent further damage and frizz. 
                        When applying the shampoo, I use a scalp massager to both exfoliate my scalp as well as help to promote hair growth. 
                        I will apply shampoo twice to only my scalp, before applying conditioner. 
                        I will only apply conditioner to the ends of my hair and leave it on for a while. 
                        At the end of my shower, I will rinse my hair with cold water and occasionally I will do an apple cider vinegar hair rinse.
                    </p>
                   <p>
                        When I step out of the shower, I’ll squeeze out any excess water and loosely wrap my hair in a microfibre towel turban.
                        Once I am dressed, I will remove the towel and apply the hair primer and leave-in conditioner to my hair. I comb out any tangles and leave to air dry.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                       Once my hair is dry, I’ll apply a couple drops of hair oil to the ends of my hair. This helps to reduce frizz and adds shine.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                        In between my weekly wash, I’ll cleanse my scalp if I need to with a co-wash. 
                        I find this really helps to freshen up my hair without drying the ends out, compared to if I were to wash with shampoo. 
                        I will do this every 2-3 days and my after shower hair care remains the same.

                        Daily Haircare: <br>
                        To prevent damage to my hair, I will keep it in a protective hairstyle most of the time. These include braids and buns. 
                        I’ll either use an invisible scrunchy or hair stick. These don’t pull on hair and they can very stylish. 
                        I will regularly apply a hair oil to the ends of my hair if I need to. 
                   </p>
                   <p>
                        When I go to bed, I brush my hair. Starting from the bottom, gently with my wooden brush. 
                        I apply a little hair oil, then braid my hair loosely securing with a soft scrunchy. 
                        Unless I am doing an overnight hair mask, I will sleep on a silk pillowcase.

                       Monthly Haircare: <br>
                       Every month I will do the ‘search and destroy’ method. 
                       To do this, I divide my hair into inch wide sections and search for any split ends along the length of my hair. 
                       When I find one, I snip the split end using a sharp pair of scissors (use scissors responsibly). 
                       This can be a long process, but also a therapeutic one.
