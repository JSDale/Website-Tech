                       From the age of 17, I would heat style my hair without any protection. When I was 18, I started dip dying my hair with semi-permanent box dye. 
                        In August 2018, I made the worst decision ever and dyed my hair blonde all over with a box dye. Already at that point it was dry and extremely damaged. 
                        In December 2018 I had it dyed red by my hairdresser; it turned out brighter than I wanted but I let it fade out and didn’t dye it for a while.

                        In March 2019 I had enough of the pink mess and dyed it brown using a box dye. 
                        Throughout the year it had faded on the ends where my previously bleached hair was going out. It looked very ‘blocky’, 
                        so in December 2019 I had a professional balayage.
                        I was in love with the results, but it needed to be a working progress in order for the colouring to look more natural. 
                        I experimented with the Curly Girl Method (CGM) from February 2020,
                        but it was a lot of effort to keep and I just didn’t have the time or the patience with the transition period. 
                        Since then, I have only been using natural based hair products without any sulphates, silicones or parabens.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My goal is to grow long healthy hair. I have done a lot of research to find out the ‘ins’ and ‘outs’ of my hair type and the best ways to look after it. 
                        With everything I have learnt, I hope to help and inspire others, just as I have been.

                        My hair is my crown I wear every day.
