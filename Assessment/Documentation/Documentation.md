# Website Technology Documentation
## 1.1.1 Background Information on the Project
The website I have created is a Hair Care blog. For a while, my partner has considered trying to become a ‘Hair Blogger’ in her personal time as hair care is something she really cares about. Over the past year she has done a tonne of research into her hair type and how to keep it healthy. She then took to Instagram and created an account to post images of her hair at its different stages. After a month or so she managed to gain 100+ followers and decided to write to a blog to help people who were in her situation a year ago. She felt that a lot of people want to get their hair looking healthy, but don’t have the time or money to try things out. The blog will tell the story her and her hair have gone through, inspiring others to go on a journey with their hair. There will also be a “Contact Me” page so that if any readers wish to know more, they can. 
## 1.1.2 Wire Frames
In the same directory tree as this document is a folder named Wireframes, there you can find the wire frame models of the website for both mobile and desktop site.
## 1.1.3 Color Choices
The color scheme for this website was easy to choose, as the Instagram account my partner uses for her hair is called “Jadie Lavender”. So, it only makes sense to choose a color scheme with lavender or light purple in. At first, I used a block color throughout the web pages, but this made the website seem outdated. I then had the idea to use a slight gradient in the background color to give it a more modern feel. I used the base color of her Logo as a starting point. Using a hex color picker I slightly lightened the base color and set that as the second color. I lightened the secondary color again to give a tertiary color which would go in the middle of the web pages. The gradient starts dark, gets a little lighter, gets more lighter, goes back to darker and finishes on the same color as the Logo. Paired with a white font color, I think this color scheme gives an elegant and refined look to the web pages that doesn’t detract from the content.
## 1.1.4 W3C Code 
To conform with W3C, I used their Nu Html Checker (found here - https://validator.w3.org/ ) this goes through the html of a webpage and spots any errors, I used the upload file option. The Home page only had a few issues, some ids needed to be changed to classes and there were comments that needed taken out. I also got a colleague (who is a web developer turned software engineer) to code review it.
