# W3C Compliance Documenation
## How I Tested the Code
To Ensure my website code (html, css and java script) files all complied with W3C's standards I ran them through an online tool that compares the contents of the files against the standards. The tool can be found here: https://validator.w3.org/.
## The Results
All of my html and css files comply to W3C standards according to the tool. However, my java script has a few errors and warnings.
## How to Repeat the Tests
If you follow the link provided above, it takes you to the main page of the tool. Once there, you can use the websites address, upload a file or copy and paste the code straight into a text area. For the css and html files I used my github link: https://jsdale.github.io/Website-Tech/Assessment/ {name_of_webpage.html or .css}. I couldn't do that for the java script files so, instead I uploaded the files from my local file directory.
